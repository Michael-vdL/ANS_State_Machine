# PLACE HOLDER FILE FOR FUNCTION IDEAS
# 1.) Few Set of Functions that Users can give states access to
# ex --> on_enter -> Has its own API that it can read from files and has lots of options of things to do based on API
# Pros: API Means we control functionality, easier to use
# Cons: Modular but limited to the constraints of our API + We would have to develop an API
# 2.) List of func_foo.py files that anyone could add and script themselves and just have build in ability to call any func_foo.py
# Pros: Complete Modularity and Functionality is limited by users intellegence
# Cons: Not as user friendly, would require a background in programming to use
